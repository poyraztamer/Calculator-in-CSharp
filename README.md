 *  A calculator attempt in C-Sharp language, it behaves as a Windows type     *
 *               calculator,but only the simple mode.                          *
 *  You can use both by clicking the buttons with mouse or keyboard,           *
 *  by clicking i couldn't find any crashes, but when using keyboard sometimes *
 *  it behaves weird, especially after doing a percentage calculation and      *
 *  if you decide to continue another calculation,it can crash or show the     *
 *  result as zero. I know it's about the boolians,there are too many boolians *
 *  to control the situations and i know i'm missing something but i'm really  *
 *  bored :)                                                                  *
 *  i found out that sometimes the enter key calls the reset function but i    * 
 *  couldn't figure why, maybe a broken keyboard is sending wrong signal,      *
 *  who knows...                                                               *     
 *                                                                             *
